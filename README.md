# Social-liteapp
A fullstack web application primarily demonstrating use of express-react, providing plenty of examples in a known concept.

A fullstack Facebook clone, demonstrating competency both react and express, while utilising Cloudinary to store images.
The objective of this project was to apply knowledge of fullstack fundamentals, learn and produce a simple full stack web application, while allowing creative branches from a simple base.

Stack and technologies: Reactjs, Expressjs, Cloundinary, Mongodb

backend repo: [social-express](https://github.com/emcleandev/Social-express)

# Features
- User authentication with email confirmation
- Friends managment - adding, removing etc.
- Posting with images and text
- Expressive Reacting to posts.


# Enjoyable Moments
- A unique exprience was implementing a reduce mapping function for the post's reacts. that specific discussion simply reminded me of dynamic programming and that was enough to be the most enjoyble.
- fyi: I do like complexity issues no and again, given the scope of the project I wasn't expecting any at all.
