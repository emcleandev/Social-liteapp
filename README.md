# Features
- User authentication with email confirmation
- Friends managment - adding, removing etc.

- Expressive Reacting to posts.


# Enjoyable Moments
- A unique exprience was implementing a mapping function for the post's reacts. that specific discussion simply reminded me of dynamic programming and that was enough to be the most enjoyble.
- fyi: I do like complexity issues no and again, given the scope of the project I wasn't expecting any at all.
